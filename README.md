# MyNewsFeedApp

This app has a simple UI, which shows most recent news on startup. We can also select various sections 
of our choice. A search option is also available to search for a particular news.

I am using an API provided by "The Guradian" to fetch news data.

Though the app is in it's basic stage and is under progress, it satisfies its basic functionality.

Thanks
